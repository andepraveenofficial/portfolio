## Introduction

### ReactJS
* __React JS__ is an open-source JavaScript library. It was developed by Facebook. 
* React code written by Facebook developers, and maintained by Facebook.
* ReactJS is used to building __user interfaces__.  
* we can create __Single Page Applications (SPA)__ by using ReactJS.
* React allows us to create __reusable components__ and __Composable Components__. 
* React at the end of the day is just Javascript.

 ### Advantages of ReactJS
 * Open Source
 * Easy to Learn
 * Large Community
 * SPA Applications
 * Reusable of components
 * Virtual DOM

 ### React Version
Now I am using latest version.
  `react@18.2.0`

<summary>ReactApp Setup with CDN</summary>

## ReactApp Setup with CDN

### Running Javascript in HTML
We can run JavaScript in HTML using the HTML `<script>` element. It is used to include JavaScript in HTML.
Here the __type__ attribute specifies the type of the `<script>`.

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
    const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");

    const element = document.createElement("h1");
    element.textContent = "Hello World!";
    element.classList.add("greeting");
    console.log(element)

    rootElement.appendChild(element);
</script>
```

### Running External Javascript in HTML
We can run JavaScript in HTML using the HTML `<script>` element. It is used to include JavaScript in HTML.
Here the __type__ attribute specifies the type of the `<script>`.
To include an external JavaScript file, we can use the HTML `<script>` element with the attribute __src__.
The __src__ attribute specifies the path of an external JS file.

```html 
<!--JS Code-->
<script type="text/javascript" src="./index.js">

```

### ReactJS with CDN

#### CDN 
__CDN__ stands for __Content Delivery Network__  
* React CDN code is a plain javascript, So ReactJS is javascript library.
* with React CDNs Browser understand the React JS.

```html 
    <!--CDN Links-->
    <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>  <!--React-->
    <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script> <!--ReactDOM-->
```

* Why two CDN files?
   - React not only works on browsers, it also works on mobile phones as __react Native__.
   - React works on different places.  

* Now we can Write ReactJS code in external js file.


### React Element
* `React.createElement()` method used to create an element using React JS.  
* It is similar to the `document.createElement()` method in regular Javascript.
* Syntax : `React.createElement(type, {attributes}, children)`
* type => tag names => `h1`, `div`
* attributes => `className`, `onClick`, `id`
* children => `"Hello World"`, `<h1>Hello Universe</h1>` 

* attributes and children are optional.

```js 
// Heading Element
const Heading = React.createElement("h1", {className: 'greeting'}, "Hello World")
```

### ReactDOM
__ReactDOM__ connect to the __Real DOM__.
* `ReactDOM.render()` method is used to display the React element.
* Syntax : `ReactDOM.render(reactElement, container); `

reactElement => What to render 
container => where to render


#### Example 

```js 
/*
// html code
<div id="root">
	<div class="parent">
		<div class="child">
			<h1 class="greeting">Hello World!</h1>
			<h1 class="greeting">Hello Universe!</h1>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>
*/

// what to render => // (type, {attributes}, children)
const heading1 = React.createElement(
	'h1',
	{ className: 'greeting' },
	'Hello World!',
);
const heading2 = React.createElement(
	'h1',
	{ className: 'greeting' },
	'Hello Universe!',
);
const child = React.createElement('div', { className: 'child' }, [
	heading1,
	heading2,
]);
const parent = React.createElement('div', { className: 'parent' }, child);
console.log(parent); // Object

// where to render
const rootElement = document.getElementById('root');

// Create root
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(rootElement);

// Render
root.render(parent);

```

<summary>JSX</summary>

## JSX
__JSX__ stands for __JavaScript XML__
* ReactJS introduced a new HTML like syntax named JSX to create elements. So, JSX makes life easier.
* Web browsers can only read regular JS.
* Our browser cannot understand JSX.
* JSX needs to be converted to the regular JS by using Babel.
* JSX allows us to write HTML like Syntax in JavaScript without any `React.createElement()` method.

```js
// JSX Syntax
const element = <h1 className="greeting">Hello World!</h1>;
```

### Babel
* Babel is a JavaScript transpiler.
* Babel converts JSX into Javascript functions that understand the React. 
* React elements are converted into Regular JS.
* We can write a React component without using JSX.
* Anything you can do with JSX can also be done with JavaScript also.
* Flow : JSX => React.createElement() -> Object => HTML code


```js
// BABEL CDN
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone/babel.min.js"></script>
```

```js 

// Without JSX
const Heading = React.createElement(
	'h1',
	{ className: 'greeting' },
	'Hello World!',
);
```

```js 


// With JSX
const Heading = <h1 className="greeting">Hello World!</h1>
```

### JS Code in JSX
we can use curly braces `{}` to write any JS code inside __JSX__.

```js 
 {/* Single line JSX Comment*/}

{/* 
Multiline JSX Comment
Multiline JSX Comment
*/}

const number = 26;
const calculation = <h1>{100+200}</h1>
const dynamicVariable = <h1>{number}</h1>
const templateLiteral = <h1>{`My age is ${number}`}</h1>

```

### React Fragment 
* __Fragment__ is used to return multiple elements from a React component.
*  __Fragment__ is used to group a list of children without adding extra node to the DOM.  
* The __Fragment__ is an alternate way to return a single JSX element. 
* `<></>` is the shorthand tag for `React.Fragment`. 
* The only difference between `<React.Fragment></React.Fragment>` and `<></>` is that the `<></>` does not support the `key` attribute.

```js 
return (
<React.Fragment>
    <Header/>
    <Body/>
    <Footer/>
</React.Fragment>
)

```

```js 
return(
<>
    <Header/>
    <Body/>
    <Footer/>
</>
)

```

```js 
return(
<>
    <Header/>
    <>
        <SideBar>
        <Body/>
    </>
    <Footer/>
</>
)
```

<summary>Custom ReactApp Setup</summary>

## Custom ReactApp Setup

### npm
npm is a packages' manager.
Generally we can say  __node package manager__, but it has no abbreviation.
npm is a standard central repository for all the node packages.
we can easily install any __Node.js__ package or library by using the `npm` command followed by the name of the package.  
Example : `npm install react`


### Local __npm__
Local `npm` helps in managing our React project __dependencies__ by creating a `package.json` file. 
This `package.json` file contains information about our project and the specific packages it depends on. 
It keeps track of the package versions used in our project.
* we use __Local npm__ because we want a lot of packages in our ReactApp.
* `npm` simplifies the process of installing and managing packages in our Node.js projects by providing a centralized repository and a command-line interface to install packages with ease.

### ReactApp Setup
1. Local `npm` setup   
   - `npm init` : This command allows you to provide your own configuration for create `package.json` file.
   - `npm init -y` : This command automatically creates the `package.json` file with default settings, skipping the custom configuration. 
2. `package.json` 
   - This file is mandatory for every project.
   - It is automatically created after `npm` setup.
   - It is used to manage information about the ReactApp, such as its name, version, dependencies, and more.
3. install `DevDependencies`
    - DevDependencies are dependencies required for development purposes only.
    - `DevDependencies` should contain modules/packages a developer needs during development.
    - These packages are necessary only while you are developing your project, not necessary on production.
    - such as, `parcel, webpack, vite`.
   `npm install -D parcel`
4. install `Dependencies`
   - Dependencies are the normal dependencies required for the ReactApp to work.
   - `npm install react` 
   - `npm install react-dom`   
5. `package-lock.json`
   - It is automatically created after dependencies installation.
   - It maintains the exact versions of dependencies.
   - It also keeps track of all the exact versions of the dependencies used in the ReactApp.
6. commands
    - The `npm install` command is used to recreate the node_modules directory.
    - It reads the package.json file and installs all the required packages mentioned in the file.
 

### Versions 
In the `package.json` file, the ~ and ^ symbols are used to define the version ranges for the packages installed.
**~** or **^** in `package.json` file : 
These are used with the versions of the package installed.

* **~**: It will update you to all future patch versions but without incrementing the minor version.
* **^** : It will update you to all future minor/patch versions without incrementing the major version.
* If none of them is present, that means only the version specified in `package.json` file is used in the development.

For example  in `package.json` file:

 ```js
"devDependencies": {
    "parcel": "^2.10.3" // ^ => Will automatically update to future minor upgrades
}
```

 ```js
"devDependencies": {
    "parcel": "~2.10.3" // ~ => Will automatically update to future patch upgrades
}
```

 ```js
"devDependencies": {
    "parcel": "2.10.3" // No automatic upgrade
}
```

### npx
   - `npx` is a tool that comes with `npm`, when you installed npm above 5.2.0 version then automatically `npx` will be installed. It is a npm package runner that can execute any package that you want from the npm.
   - `npx` command is used to execute the package.
   - Example : `npx parcel index.html`
   - After Executing `npx parcel index.html` package Automatically two Folders are created .
      * `.parcel-cache`
      * `dist`

### node_modules
- `node_modules` folder like a cache for the external modules that your project depends upon.
- The `npm install` command is used to recreate the node_modules directory using the `package-lock.json` file.
- When you `npm install` them, they are downloaded from the web and copied into the node_modules folder and Nodejs is trained to look for them there when you import them(without a specific path).
- Here we can store all the superpowers.
- `Don't push node_modules`in GitHub because it contains lots of files(more than 200 MB), it will cost you memory space.
- we don't put "node_modules" into git, because our `package-lock.json` file have sufficient information to recreate node_modules.  
`package-lock.json` file keep & maintain the versions of everything in node_modules.

### Scripts 
  * server start
     - we can add key for avoiding every time start server `npx parcel index.html`.
     - `"start" : "npx parcel index.html"`
     - Now we can start the server with `npm run start` or `npm start`.
  * App build 
      - `"build": "npx parcel build index.html"`  
      - Now we can build the app with `npm run build`.  	
  * `npx = npm run`  
```js 
   "scripts": {
		"start": "parcel index.html",
		"build": "parcel build index.html",
		"test": "jest"
	},     
```

### stop the server
   - `ctrl + c`

### .gitignore
* Anything which can be auto-generated should be put inside `.gitignore file`.  
* The `.gitignore file` is a text file that tells `Git` which files or folders to `ignore` in a project during commit to the repository.  
* For example, For security, the security key files and API keys should get added to the `.gitignore`.

The entries in this `.gitignore` file can also follow a matching pattern.

```bash
# is used to add comments to a .gitignore file

* is used as a wildcard match
/ is used to ignore pathnames relative to the .gitignore file
```

```bash
# Ignore node_modules folder
node_modules

# Ignore all text files
*.txt

# Ignore files related to API keys
.env

```

### package-lock.json
* `package-lock.json` is a file that helps future developers and automated systems to easily download and install the same dependencies as your project.
* It also allows you to switch to previous versions of the dependencies without actually saving changes to the node_modules folder.
* The `package-lock.json` file contains important information about the dependencies and their specific versions used in your project. If you modify or delete this file, it can cause problems with the dependencies when deploying your project in the production environment. It's best not to modify the package-lock.json file because __npm__ automatically handles it for you to ensure the correct dependencies are installed.

### Q: What is the `dist` folder?
we run command `npx parcel index.html` this will create a faster development version of our project & serves it on the server.  
The /dist folder contains the minified version of your source code that is used in production for web applications.  It includes all the necessary files and modules that have been optimized and made as small as possible. This folder holds the final code that is ready to be deployed and used by users.  
`npx parcel build index.html` it creates a lot of things, minify your file. and "parcel will build all the production files to the dist folder".

### Q: What is `browserslist`?
A: `Browserslist` is a tool that allows specifying which browsers should be supported in your frontend app by specifying "queries" in a config file. It's used by frameworks/libraries such as React, Angular and Vue, but it's not limited to them.

### parcel 
parcel is basically a bundler.  
It is bundle our application. 
it takes all your files and bundle into one file.

### App Example 

```js 
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

// what to render
const parent = (
	<div class="parent">
		<div class="child">
			<h1 className="greeting">Hello World!</h1>
			<h1 className="greeting">Hello Universe!</h1>
		</div>
	</div>
);
console.log(parent); // Object

// where to render
const rootElement = document.getElementById('root');

// Create root
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(rootElement);

// Render
// The `ReactDOM.render()` method returns only one element in render.
root.render(parent);

```

<summary>Ready Made ReactApp Setup</summary>

## Ready Made ReactApp Setup
Creating a real-world application involves a lot of setup because a large number of components need to be organised.
1. create-react-app
2. create-vite

### Create React Application
1. Install `Node.js` from the official website.
2. Install Create React App globally
    * `npm install -g create-react-app`
3. Create a new React project
    * `npx create-react-app myapp`
    * It generates a ready-made React application setup.
4. Navigate to the project folder
    * `cd myapp`
5. Start the development server 
    * `npm start`
6. Now you can work on your React Project


### Bundler 

#### Javascript Bundlers
* Bundlers are tools that help manage and combine different pieces of JavaScript code. 
* To use a tool or library in our code, we need a package manager like `npm` or `yarn`.  

`npm install webpack --save-dev`
`npm install parcel --save-dev`

In React, to get external functionalities, we use Bundlers.  
1. Parcel
2. Webpack -> Create React App
3. Vite -> React Vite

#### Common Bundler Features
1. Local Server => It creates a Local server 
2. Port Number
3. Tree Shaking
4. Minification
5. HMR (Hot Module Reload) -> File Watcher Algorithm
6. Bundling -> Dev Build
7. Error Suggestions
8. Image Optimization
9. Clearing our code
10. Caching - Faster Builds =>  Super Fast build algorithm
11. Compatible with older version of browser 


### Minification 
* Minification is the process of making your code and markup smaller by removing unnecessary spaces, line breaks, and other characters that are not essential for the code to run correctly. It aims to reduce the size of the files to optimize website performance and improve loading times.
* When you write code or markup for a website or a script file, you typically use indentation, line breaks, and comments to make it more readable and understandable for yourself and other developers. However, when the code gets sent over the internet to the user's browser, all of these extra characters are not necessary for the browser to understand and execute the code.

### Tree Shaking 
* `Tree shaking` is process of removing the unwanted code that we do not use while developing the application. 
* Tree shaking is a dead code elimination technique that is applied when optimizing code.
* Example :  We are importing a library which has a lot of functions (20 functions). then, all those 20 functions will come into your code. But in my app, I may want to use only 1 or 2 out of it.  
Here Parcel will ignore all the unused code.  

### HMR (Hot Module Reload)
* `HMR (Hot Module Replacement)` - adds, or removes modules while an application is running, without a full reload.
* There is `File Watcher Algorith` (Written in C++). It keeps track of all the files which are changing realtime & it tells the server to reload.  


### Q: What is `.parcel-cache`?
A `.parcel-cache` is used by parcel(bundler) to reduce the building time.
It stores information about your project when parcel builds it, so that when it rebuilds, it doesn't have to reparse and re-analyze everything from scratch. It's a key reason why parcel can be so fast in development mode.

### Q: What is the `dist` folder?
we run command `npx parcel index.html` this will create a faster development version of our project & serves it on the server.  
The /dist folder contains the minified version of your source code that is used in production for web applications.  It includes all the necessary files and modules that have been optimized and made as small as possible. This folder holds the final code that is ready to be deployed and used by users.  
`npx parcel build index.html` it creates a lot of things, minify your file. and "parcel will build all the production files to the dist folder".

<summary>React Component</summary>

## React Component
* A Component is a normal JS function that returns a JSX element. 
* End of the day any Component is JS Object.

```js 
// Component
const Welcome = () => <h1 className="message">Hello World</h1>;
```

* Generally developers are used Component name as PascalCase.
* PascalCase is recommended for naming convention of Component.

### Call the Component

```js
// Return JSX
return (
    <div>
        {Welcome()}
        <Welcome/>
        <Welcome></Welcome>
    </div>
 
)

```

### Call the Element

```js 
const myElement = <h1>Hello World</h1>;
const number = 27;
	// Return JSX
	return (
		<div>
			{/* ----- React Element Calling ----- */}
			{myElement}
			
			{/*----- JScode in JSX-----*/}
			{number}
			<h1>{number}</h1>
			<h1>{`My age is ${number}`}</h1>
			{console.log('Hello JS Code')}
		</div>
	);
```

### Export/Import
In __ES6__, the `export` and `import` keywords are used to write JS code one file and use it in another file.
__ES6__ provides `export` a module and `import` in another module to use it.   

1. Default Export/Import
    - `export default MyComponent`; 
    - `import MyComponent from "./path"`;
2. Named Export/Import
    -   `export const MyComponent1 = <h1>MyComponent</h1>;`
    -   `import {MyComponent} from "./path";`
3. __as__ import 
   - `import {MyComponent as Heading} from "./path"`;  
   - In `*`, it is used to import the whole module as a component and access the components inside the module.

```js
// MyComponent File
export const MyComponent1 = () => {}
export const MyComponent2 = () => {}
export const MyComponent3 = () => {}
``` 

```js
import * as MainComponents from "./MyComponent";

return (
    <MainComponents.MyComponent1 />
    <MainComponents.MyComponent2 />
    <MainComponents.MyComponent3 />
)

```

### We can use `Named export` and `Default export` together.
```js
export const MyComponent1 = () => {}
export const MyComponent2 = () => {}

const MyComponent = () => {}

export default MyComponent;
```

```Javascript
import MyComponent, {MyComponent1, MyComponent2} from "./MyComponent";
```

### Reusable Component
A Component is a piece of code that can be used in various parts of an application.
* We can write Component once and use it multiple times.
* We can use number of times of same component.

```js 
// Import External Components
import Child from './components/Child'

const Parent = () => (
    <div>
        <Child greeting="Hello" name="Praveen Ande"/>
        <Child greeting="Hello" name="Brenden Eich"/>
    </div>
)

// Default Export 
export default Parent;

```

```js 
const Child = (props) => {
// props object Destructuring
const {greeting, name} = props;

// Retur JSX 
return (
       <div>
          {greeting} {name}
       </div>
  );
};
```

### Composable Component
If one Component is used inside another Component. Then it is called Component Composition.

```js 
import MyComponent from "./MyComponent";

return (
    <div>
        <MyComponent/>
        <MyComponent/>
        <MyComponent/>
    </div>
)
```

### HOC
__HOC__ stands for __Higher Order Component__  
A __Higher Order Component__ is function that takes a component and modify some changes and return back as a new component.

```js 
import React from 'react';

// Header component
const Header = () => <h1>This is a header</h1>;

// Define a higher-order component
const withRedColor = (Component) => {
    return () => (
        <div style={{ color: 'red' }}>
            <Component />
        </div>
    );
};

// Usage
const RedHeader = withRedColor(Header);


```

### Pure Function
In Javascript, when functions returns same output when same input is passed is called Pure functions. It is like returning same data for same input. So in pure function output only depend on its input arguments. Pure functions does not produce any side effects as well.

```js
function Add(num1, num2){
  return num1 + num2;
}

let output = Add(1,2);
console.log(output);  // 3
```

### Pure Component
We know that in React we can create a component in two different ways that one is Class component/ Stateful component and another is Functional component/Stateless component.  
A React component can be considered pure if it renders the same output for the same state and props.
Pure component does not give any side effects.
We can convert component to pure component as below:

* For __class components__ react provides `React.PureComponent` base class.
* For __Functional component__ react provides `React.memo`.


### React.PureComponent
Now, by extending `PureComponent` instead of `Component`, this class benefits from the default `shouldComponentUpdate` method provided by PureComponent, which performs a shallow comparison of __props__ and __state__ to determine if a re-render is necessary. In this specific example, since the name state doesn't change during the changeName method, the PureClassComponent won't re-render unnecessarily.

```js
import React, { PureComponent } from "react";

class PureClassComponent extends PureComponent {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = {
      name: "React JS"
    };
  }
    
  // Methods  
  changeName = () => {
    this.setState({ name: "React JS" });
  };

  render() {
    console.log("PureClassComponent -- Render method called");
    
    // Return JSX
    return (
      <div>
        <p> Name is : {this.state.name} </p>
        <button onClick={this.changeName}>Change Name</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default PureClassComponent;

```

### React.memo
* `React.memo` is similar to `React.PureComponent` and it is for functional component instead of class component. 
* It memoize the Component. The Component is re-recreated when props or state of the Components Updated. 
* you can avoid re-rendering when the same props and state of the Component.
* The `memo` function is used for memoizing functional component to prevent unnecessary renders.

```js 
import React, { memo } from "react";

const MyComponent = ({ name = "Default Name" }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      {console.log("MyComponent render")}
      <label>
        <b>{name}</b>
      </label>
    </div>
  );
};

export default memo(MyComponent);

```

### Types of Components
1. __Class__ Component
2. __Functional__ Component

#### Class Component
* If class name starts with Capital letter then only react treats as Component otherwise react treats as HTML Element.
* The component name should always be in the pascal case.
* Class Component we can call as **stateful** Component.
* A class component requires you to extend from React `Component` and create a `render` method that returns a JSX element.

```js
// The `extends` keyword is used to inherit methods and properties from the `React.Component`.
import { Component } from "react";

class App extends Component {

  // Updating
  render() {

    // Return JSX
    return <div>App Component</div>;
  }
}
```

```js
/* -----> Third Party Packages <----- */
import React, { Component } from "react";

/* -----> Class Component <----- */
class App extends Component {
  // Initialization
  constructor(props) {
// `super(props)` is used initialize the properties of Parent when we initialize our component.

    super(props);
    this.state = { name: "Ande Praveen" };
  }

  // Methods
  timer = () => {
    console.log("timer Method");
  };

  clearTimer = () => {
    console.log("clearTimer Method");
  };

  // Mounting
  componentDidMount() {
    this.apiCall();
    console.log("App Component Mounted");
  }
    
// Update
 componentDidUpdate(){
console.log("componentDidUpdate called");
}

  // Unmounting
  componentWillUnmount() {
    this.deleteApiCall();
console.log("App Component Unmounted");
  }

  // Updating
  render() {
    console.log("render method")

    // Return JSX
    return <div>App Component</div>;
  }
}

/* -----> Default Export <----- */
export default App;

```

#### Functional Component
  * A functional component is just a JavaScript function that accepts props as an argument and returns a React JSX element.
  * There is no render method used in functional components.
  * If component have don't have any state, then It is called Stateless component.
  * React lifecycle methods `(constructor, componentDidMount, componentWillUnmount, render ...etc.)` cannot be used in functional component.

```js 
const App = () => {
  
  // Return JSX
  return (
    <div>App Component</div>
  )
}
```

<summary>State</summary>

## state
* State is created and managed within the component, similar to a variable declared within the function.
* State is used to store the component's data that changes over time.
* We can update state 
  - `setState` method in class Component
  - `const[name, setName] = useState` hook in Functional Component
* when the state changes, automatically the component re-renders.
* If we try to update the state directly then it won't re-render the component.
* state should be immutable

### setState
The setState is a method to modify the current state.
When the state object changes, the component re-renders.

```js 
// Initialization
  constructor(props){
        super(props)
        this.state = {count:0}  // When the state object changes, the component re-renders.
    }

// Methods
    onIncrement = () => {
        // updating state
        this.setState((prevState) => ({count:prevState.count+1}))  // Function as an argument
    }

    onReset = () => {
		// updating state
        this.setState( {count:0} )  // Object as an argument
    }

```

### setState() callback function
The `setState()` method is a asynchronous, it takes an optional callback parameter that can be used to make updates after the state is changed.

```js  
this.setState({key1:value1}, callback)
```

### React Batch Updating
React combines multiple `setState()` calls into single update.

```js 
import { Component } from "react"

class App extends Component {
  state = { count: 0 }

  onIncrement = () => {
    this.setState((prevState) => ({ count: prevState.count + 1 }))
    this.setState((prevState) => ({ count: prevState.count + 1 }))
    this.setState((prevState) => ({ count: prevState.count + 1 }))
  }

// when you click on the Increase button only one time render will be triggered.

  render() {
    const { count } = this.state
    console.log("render() called")
    return (
      <>
        <p className="count">Count {count}</p>
        <button onClick={this.onIncrement}>Increase</button>
      </>
    )
  }
}

export default App
```

`output : count is 3`

<summary>props</summary>

## props

* `Props` stands for __Properties__.
* We can pass information from __Parent Component__ to __Child Component__ by using props.
* props are just normal arguments.
* In functions, It is like pass arguments to a function.
* In Component, It is like pass properties to a component.
* props are used in React to pass data from one component to another (from a parent component to a child component).
* The child component accept props as parameters and can be accessed directly.
* Child Component can't change the props.
* props are immutable. A component cannot change the props.
* props are read-only.

```js 
// Import External Components
import Child from './components/Child'

const Parent = () => (
<div>
    <Child greeting="Hello" name="Praveen Ande"/>
    <Child greeting="Hello" name="Brenden Eich"/>
</div>
)

// Default Export 
export default Parent;

```

```js 
const Child = (props) => {
// props object Destructuring
const {greeting, name} = props;

// Retur JSX 
return (
    <div>
        {greeting} {name}
    </div>
);
};

// Default Export
export default Child;
```

### Prop Drilling
Prop Drilling is a process in which Props are passed from one Component to another Component that does not need the data but only helps in passing it through the tree.

Example : We have grand, parent, and child components. In this scenario, we want to pass props from the grand to the child. However, the parent component acts as a mediator, receiving props from the grand and passing them to the child.

### `key` prop in listItem
* A `key` is a special attribute you need to include when creating list of elements in React. Keys are used in React to identify which items in the list are changed, updated, or deleted.
* Otherwise, React cannot understand which item is newly added or removed or modified.
* without key property react re-render the all the list items.
* Most often, we would use IDs (uniqueNo) from our data as keys.
* We tell the difference among its siblings of list.

```js 
  return (
    <ul>
      {items.map((item, index) => (
        <li key={index}>{item}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
```

* Don't use __index__ as a key. please use __unique id__.
* Yes, we can use the `index as keys`, but it is not considered as a good practice to use them because if the order of items may change.

### defaultProps
`defaultProps` is a property in React Component used to set default values for the props.
This is similar to adding default parameters to the function.

```js 

/* -----> Components <----- */

const Welcome = (props) => {
    const {greeting, name} = props

    // return JSX
    return(
        <div>
            <h1>
                {greeting}, {name}
            </h1>
        </div>

    )
}

/* -----> Default Props <----- */
Welcome.defaultProps = {
    name: "Rahul",
    greeting: "Hi"
};


/* -----> Default Export <----- */
export default Welcome;

```

### props are de-structured on Fly 

```js
const App = () => {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <MyComponent name="Praveen" age={20}/> {/* name and age are props */} 
    </div>
  )
}
```

```js
// Destructure on Fly
const MyComponent = ({name, age}) => {
return (
    <h1>{name}</h1>
    <h1>{age}</h1>)
}
```

### children prop
`Children` is a prop that allow you to pass components as data to other components. The data between component's __opening__ and __closing__ tag will be passed to other component as children prop.

```js 
const Message = (props) => {
const first = props.children[0]
const last = props.children[1]
return (
   <div>
      {first}
      {last}
  </div>
);

}

export default Message
```

```js 
import Message from './components/Message';

const App = () => (
  <Message>
    <span>Hello</span>
    <span>World</span>
</Message>
)

export default Message
```

### Unidirectional
* The data flow of React is a Unidirectional data flow.
* Unidirectional data flow means a __one-way__ data flow where the data has only one way to be passed to all the child components.
* It means only one component can maintain and update the `state`. The state is passed to the child components through props.
* When we want to update the state by the event triggered in the child component, we can't directly change the props in child components as props are read-only.

Some of the advantages of Unidirectional data flow are:
* we have more control over the data
* Easier to debug as we know what data is coming from where

<summary>Component Life Cycle</summary>

## Component Life Cycle
__Component Life Cycle__ is a different Stages of the Component during its existence.
![Class Component Life Cycle](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwrwbjd3h/image/upload/v1711017681/portfolio/markdown/react/Life_Cycle.png)

### Component Stages
1. Mounting
2. Updating
3. Unmounting

#### Mounting
In the Mounting Stage, the instance of a component is created and inserted into the Real DOM.

#### Updating
In Updating Stage, the component is updated whenever there is a change in the component's state. 

#### Unmounting
In Unmounting Stage, the component instance is removed from the DOM. 

### React phases
1. render phase => creating the virtual DOM => constructor + render
2. commit phase => DOM updated in single batch 

### Class Component Life Cycle methods
It is How the class based component in mounted on the Real DOM.  
when the class loads, automatically constructor is called.

1. constructor => initialize the properties and state
2. render => return JSX
3. componentDidMount => after component mounted => Initial render
4. componentDidUpdate => after first render
5. componentWillUnmount => after component unmounted

### Life Cycle Methods Flow
* Mounting Phase
  - constructor()
  - render()
  - componentDidMount ()
* Updating Phase
  - render()
  - componentDidUpdate()
* Unmounting Phase
  - componentWillUnmount()


#### constructor()
The `constructor()` method is used to setup the initial state and initialize the instance of properties.
  
```js 
 constructor(){
super(props);
this.state = {key:"value"}
}
```

#### render()
The `render()` method is used to return the JSX that is displayed in the UI.
If more than one JSX element is to be rendered, then they must be grouped using a container element or use React fragment.
The `render()` is called whenever there is a change in the component's state.

#### componentDidMount()
The `componentDidMount()` method allows us to execute the React code After Initial render (placed in the DOM).
Examples : make API calls, Timers

#### componentWillUnmount()
The `componentWillUnmount()` is invoked immediately before a component is unmounted or destroyed. All the cleanup activities are performed in this method. 
The `componentWillUnmount()` is useful for the cleanup of the application when we switch routes from one place to another. 
Example : clearInterval, clearTimeout, Canceling network requests

<summary>Hooks</summary>

## Hooks
React Component -> Normal JS Function
React Element -> Normal JS Object
React Hook -> Normal JS FUnction with superpowers

### React Hooks Theory
* In React version 16.8, React introduced a new pattern called Hooks. 
* React Hooks are Normal JS Utility Functions.
* with the help of Hooks we can add __state__, __context__ and __lifecycle__ methods to the Functional Component.

#### React Hooks Advantages
* Components become simple and easy to understand.
* fewer lines of code.
* No need of switching between class & Function Components.

### React Hooks
1. State
    * useState()
    * useReducer()
2. Side Effects
    * useEffect()
    * useLayoutEffect() 
3. Context
    * useContext()
4. Reference
    * useRef()  
5. Memoize 
    * useMemo()
    * useCallback()
    * Memo()
6. Own Hooks
    * useCustomHook

### Rules of React Hooks 
* You must import Hooks from "react".
* Hooks can only be called inside React function components.
* Hooks can only be called at the top level of a component.

#### useState()
* `useState` hook is used to maintain the local state in Functional Component.
* The `useState` hook is a special function that takes the `initialState` as an argument and `returns an array` of two entries.

 ```js
	const counterArray = useState(0);
	const counter = arr[0];
	const setCounter = arr[1];
```

```js
import {useState} from "react";
import MyComponent from "./MyComponent"

const Example = (props) => {
  // Local State - Super powerful variable
const [state, setState] = useState(initialstate);
const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0)

  return <MyComponent/>;
}
```

```js 
// value => Independent
setterFunction(nextValue);

// callback => Dependent
setterFunction((prevState) => nextState);
```
* When a state (Data Layer) variable is updated, React re-renders the component. 
* when re-render happens UI layer will change.
* whenever State variables update, react triggers a reconciliation cycle(re-renders the component) 

#### useReducer()
This is also add Local State to the Component.  
It used to manage the complex state. 

```js
import {useReducer} from "react"

const Example = (props) => {
  // Local State
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialValue);

  return <MyComponent/>;
}
```
* when called dispatch functions, It triggers the reducer function and reducer takes 2 arguments currentState and dispatchAction. 
* what we are returning from reducer function that is stored in state.
* Best way to write reducer functions in separate file in Helpers Folder.

```js 
import{ useReducer } from 'react';

const App = () => {

	// Methods
	const counterReducer = (prevState, action) => {
		const { type, payload } = action;
		console.log(type, payload);
		let newState;
		if (type === 'increment') {
			newState = prevState + payload;
		} else {
			newState = prevState;
		}
		return newState;
	};

	// Initialization
	const [counter, dispatchCounter] = useReducer(counterReducer, 0);

	// Return JSX
	return (
		<div >
			<p>counter : {counter}</p>
			<button
				onClick={() =>
					dispatchCounter({ type: 'increment', payload: 1 })
				}
				type="button"
			>
				+
			</button>
		</div>
	);
};

export default App;

```

#### useEffect()
* The `useEffect` Hook is used to Execute Logic after the Component render.
* The `useEffect` Hook allows you to  `eliminate side effects` in your components.
* we can say `useEffect` is combination of `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, `componentWillunmount`.
* `useEffect(callback, [])`
* Example : Making API calls, Timer Functions, ...etc

```js
useEffect(() => {}, [])
// `() => {}` is callback function 
//  `[]` is called a empty dependency array. 

```

```js 
useEffect(() => {
	console.log("I run everytime this component re-renders")
});
```

```js
useEffect(() => {
	console.log("I Only run once (When the component gets mounted)")
}, []);
```

```js
useEffect(() => {
	console.log("I run every-time when my any change in conditions")
}, [condition1, condition2]);
```

**Example** : 

```js  
import {useState, useEffect} from 'react'

const Clock = () => {
  const [date, setDate] = useState(new Date())

  useEffect(() => {
    const timerId = setInterval(() => {
      setDate(new Date())
    }, 1000)
    
    // Return will Execute before component Unmount
    return () => clearInterval(timerId)
  }, [])

  return (
      <p>{date.toLocaleTimeString()}</p>
  )
}

export default Clock

```

#### useLayoutEffect()
* `useLayoutEffect` runs synchronously after a render but before the UI Layer is updated. 
* It means `useLayoutEffect` runs first than `useEffect`
* The `useLayoutEffect` function is triggered synchronously before the DOM mutations are painted. However, the `useEffect` function is called after the DOM mutations are painted.

#### useContext()
we can access __React Context__ Object with `useContext()` hook.

```js 
import React from 'react';
import { useContext } from 'react';

import MyContext from '../../context/MyContext.js';

const Child = () => {

	const { name } = useContext(MyContext);
	console.log(name);
	// Return JSX
	return <div>Child</div>;
};

export default Child;

```

#### useRef()
* The `useRef` Hook is used to update some value in your component, but no need to re-render.
* `useRef` is remembered the value.
* we can access the DOM elements. we can interact with HTML DOM without re-render.

**Types of Variables** :
1. normal variables
2. state variables
3. ref variables

When Update the state, Component will re-render.
* normal variables are reset by re-render when we change state.
* when re-render happens, state variable not be reset.
* when re-render happens, ref variable not be reset.

**Usage of useRef** : 
1. DOM manipulation
2. Memorization 

```js 
const ref = useRef(initialValue)
```

```js 
import { useRef } from 'react';

const App = () => {
	console.log('App Component');
    
    // select the Element
	let heading = useRef(null);
	console.log(headingElement);

	// Return JSX
	return (
		<div>
			<h1 ref={heading} className="in-active">
				This Heading Tag
			</h1>
			<button
				type="button"
				onClick={() => {
					// the component will not re-render when changes done with useRef
					heading.current.classList.toggle('active');
					heading.current.classList.toggle('in-active');
				}}
			>
				Click
			</button>
		</div>
	);
};

export default App;

```

#### useMemo
* `useMemo` Hook memoize the Heavy Operation result.
* `useMemo` Hook increases the performance of your application.
* When the component is re-rendered, the callback function will be executed when the values in the dependency array change.
* It stops the function execution when same dependency array values of re-render.
  
```js
const memozedValue = useMemo(heavyCalculationFunction, [dependencies])
```

```js 
import React from 'react';
import { useMemo, useState } from 'react';

const App = () => {
	console.log('App Component');

	const [isDone, setIsDone] = useState(true);

	let a = 10;
	let b = 20;

	// Methods
	const sum = (num1, num2) => {
		console.log('sum Method'); // Look Here
		return num1 + num2;
	};

	let result = useMemo(() => {
		console.log('useMemo Call'); // Look Here
		const add1 = sum(a, b);
		return add1;
	}, [a, b]);

	console.log(result);

	// Return JSX
	return (
		<div>
			<button
				type="button"
				onClick={() => {
					setIsDone(!isDone);
				}}
			>
				Update State
			</button>
		</div>
	);
};

export default App;

```

#### useCallback()
* `useCallback` Hook memoize the Function Definition.
* `useCallback` Hook increases the performance of your application.
* When the component is re-rendered, the callback function will be re-created when the values in the dependency array change.
*  using `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-creation of the function on each render.
* useMemo(fn, []) => memoize the Function returned Value
* useCallback(fn, []) => memoize the Function Definition

```js 
const cachedFn = useCallback(fn, [dependencies])
```

```js 
import { useCallback, useState } from 'react'

let fnCount = new Set();

const CallbackHook = () => {

    const [isDone, setIsDone] = useState(true)

    const fn = useCallback(() => {
        console.log("Hello World")
    }, [])

    fnCount.add(fn)

    console.log(fnCount)

    return (
        <div>
            <button onClick={() => setIsDone(!isDone)}>click</button></div>
    )
}

export default CallbackHook

```

#### memo
* It  memoize the Component. The Component is re-recreated when props or state of the Components Updated.

#### Own Hook
* we can create own hooks for Single Responsibility priciple. 
* Hooks are utility functions.
* Hooks are basically normal JS functions.
* we should mention `use` word before custom hook for identify a custom hook.
* use is not a mandatory, it is recommended. most of the developers uses the **use** word.
* custom hooks are More Readable and Reusable.

```js  useGetAPIData.js
// Hooks
// Custom Hooks

import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

export const useGetAPIData = (apiUrl) => {
	console.log('useGetAPIData Custom Hook');
	
	// Local State
	const [data, setData] = useState([]);
	
	/ Methods
	const getData = async (url) => {
		const options = {
			method: 'GET',
		};
		
		const response = await fetch(url, options);
		const data = await response.json();
		setData(data);
	};

	// Mounting
	useEffect(() => {
		getData(apiUrl);
	}, []);

	// Return Data
	return data;
};

```

```js App.js
import React from 'react';
import { useGetAPIData } from './utilities'; // Custom Hooks

const App = () => {
	console.log('App Component');

	const apiUrl = 'https://fakestoreapi.com/products/1';
	const data = useGetAPIData(apiUrl);
	console.log(data);

	// Return JSX
	return <div>Custom Hook</div>;
};

export default App;

```

<summary>Routing</summary>

## Routing
* In React, routing refers to the process of managing and navigating between different views or pages in a single-page application (SPA). 
* React doesn't come with built-in routing functionality, so developers often use third-party libraries like `react-router-dom` to implement routing in their applications.
* `react-router-dom` is a popular library used for implementing routing in React applications.

### SPA
__SPA__ stands for __single page application__
* __SPA__ enables users to move between different parts of the application without the need of a full page reload. 
* React is mainly used to build single-page applications.
* In a single page application, all URLs are associated with a single HTML page.
* On navigating we only get the additional content(Component => HTML, CSS, JS).
* Single Page Application helps in faster page loading since they load only necessary Component (HTML, CSS, JS) resources on subsequent requests.
* __SPA__ is a web application that dynamically updates the webpage without reloading/refreshing the entire page. 
* All the HTML, CSS, JS are retrieved in the initial load and other data/resources can be loaded dynamically whenever required.

### MPA 
__MPA__ stands for __Multi-page application__
* In a Multi-page application, Every URL is associated with corresponding resources (HTML, CSS, JS).
* The browser downloads these resources when you access them or navigate between URLs.


### Q: What is the difference between `Client Side Routing` and `Server Side Routing`?
A: In `Server-side routing or rendering (SSR)`, every change in URL, http request is made to server to fetch the webpage, and replace the current webpage with the older one.  
In `Client-side routing or rendering (CSR)`, during the first load, the webapp is loaded from server to client, after which whenever there is a change in URL, the router library navigates the user to the new page without sending any request to backend. All `Single Page Applications uses client-side routing`. 

### To implement __routing__, React Router provides various components.
   - BrowserRouter
   - Routes
   - Route
   - Link
   - Navigate
   - withRouter

###  BrowserRouter
To add routing, wrapping all the components with `BrowserRouter`.

### Route
The `Route` Component renders specific UI component when path matches current URL. 

### Link
Don't use `<a></a>` tag,  because the whole page get reload with anchor tag.
so use `<Link>` component of `react-router-dom`  
you can navigate to other page without reload the full page.
The `to` prop specifies absolute path.

```js 
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";

const Header = () => {
  return (
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <Link to="/">Home</Link>
        </li>
        <li>
          <Link to="/greeting">Greeting</Link>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  );
};

export default Header;
```

### Navigate
navigate Component is used to redirect to another path.

```js 
  <Navigate to="/home" replace={true} />
```

### withRouter (older version)
To provide __Routing default properties__ prop to other components, we can wrap it with the withRouter function while exporting it.
`export default withRouter(Header)`

### Route Props
when a component is rendered by the Route, some additional props are passed.
* match
* location
* history


### BrowserRouter 

```js 
/* -----> Third Party Packages <----- */
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter, Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom';

/* -----> External Components <----- */
import Header from './Layouts/Header';
import FirstPage from './Pages/FirstPage';
import SecondPage from './Pages/SecondPage';
import NotFound from './Pages/NotFound';

/* -----> Styles <----- */
import './App.css';

/* -----> Component <----- */
const App = () => {
	// Return JSX
	return (
		<BrowserRouter>
			<Header />
			<Routes>
				<Route path="/first-page" element={<FirstPage />} />
				<Route path="/second-page" element={<SecondPage />} />
				<Route path="/*" element={<NotFound />} />
			</Routes>
		</BrowserRouter>
	);
};

/* -----> Default Export <----- */
export default App;

```

### createBrowserRouter

```js 
/* -----> Third Party Packages <----- */
import React from 'react';
import { createBrowserRouter, Outlet, RouterProvider } from 'react-router-dom';

/* -----> External Components <----- */
import Header from './Layouts/Header';
import FirstPage from './Pages/FirstPage';
import SecondPage from './Pages/SecondPage';
import MoviePage from "./Pages/MoviePage"
import NotFound from './Pages/NotFound';

/* -----> Styles <----- */
import './App.css';

/* -----> Component <----- */
const App = () => {
	console.log('App');

	// Return JSX
	return (
		<div>
			<Header />
			<Outlet /> {/* Outlet is replaced by the Child Component*/}
		</div>
	);
};

// Routing Configuration
const appRouter = createBrowserRouter([
	{
		path: '/',
		element: <App />,
		children: [
			{
				path: '/first-page',
				element: <FirstPage />,
			},
			{
				path: '/second-page',
				element: <SecondPage />,
			},
            {
                path: '/movies/:movieId', //  Dynamic Path
	           element: <MoviePage />,
            } ,
		],
	errorElement: <NotFound />,
	},
]);

const AppLayout = () => {
	console.log('AppLayout');
	return <RouterProvider router={appRouter} />;
};

/* -----> Default Export <----- */
export default AppLayout;

```


```js
 /* -----> Third Party Packages <----- */
import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom';  
 
    // Access Dynamic path parameters 
	const { movieId } = useParams();

/* -----> Export <----- */
export default Card;

```

### Wrapper Component
 Redirection Logic can be reused by separating out into a React Component called Wrapper Component. Each route will be wrapped with it.

```js  
/* -----> Third Party Packages <----- */
import { Route, Navigate } from "react-router-dom";  // routing Components
import Cookies from 'js-cookie'  // Cookies is used to store data on client-side with expiry duration.

// ProtectedRoute is the Wrapper Component
const ProtectedRoute = (props) => {
    console.log("protectedRoute Wrapper Component")
    console.log(props)
    const token = Cookies.get("jwt_token");
    if (token === undefined) {
        return <Navigate to="/login" replace={true} />;
    }
    return <Route {...props} />;
};

/* -----> Default Export <----- */
export default ProtectedRoute;
```

### Router Default Properties
When a component is rendered through the __route__, some of the additional props are passed.

**They are**:
* __match__: The match object contains the information about the path from which the component is rendered.
* __history__: The history object has some methods to control the navigation in the browser. It also maintains the history of the routes we navigated. Some of the methods to control the navigation are history.push, history.replace, etc.
* __location__: The location object contains the information about the current URL.


#### useHistory
The useHistory hook gives you access to the history instance that you may use to navigate.

```js
import { useHistory } from "react-router-dom";

function HomeButton() {
  let history = useHistory();

  function handleClick() {
    history.push("/home");
  }

  return (
    <button type="button" onClick={handleClick}>
      Go home
    </button>
  );
}
```

#### useParams
useParams returns an object of key/value pairs of URL parameters. Use it to access match params of the current `<Route>`.

```js 
import * as React from 'react';
import { Routes, Route, useParams } from 'react-router-dom';

const ProfilePage = () => {
  // Get the userId param from the URL.
  let { userId } = useParams();
  // ...
}

 const App = () => {
  return (
    <Routes>
      <Route path="users">
        <Route path=":userId" element={<ProfilePage />} />
        <Route path="me" element={...} />
      </Route>
    </Routes>
  );
}
```

<summary>Context</summary>

## Context

### Application
App has 2 layers
1. Data Layer
2. UI Layer
Here, React Context is the Data Layer.

### Props Drilling
* Prop Drilling means passing data from one Component to another Component that does not need the data but only helps in passing it through the tree.
* React App passes data from Parent to Children. It passes oneway data.

### React Context (Global State)
* We can handle the Global State Management with React Context.
* React Context is used to avoid prop drilling.
* If we kept the data on global level then we can access anywhere.
* Lifting The state update

```js
import { createContext } from 'react';

const MyContext = createContext({
	name: '',
	onUpdateName: () => {},
});

export default MyContext;
```

```js 
import React from 'react';
import { useState } from 'react';

import Child from './components/Child';
import MyContext from './context/MyContext';

const App = () => {

	const [name, setName] = useState('Ande Praveen');

	const onUpdateName = (updatedName) => {
		setName(updatedName);
	};

	// React ContextObject
	const valueObject = {
		name,
		onUpdateName,
	};

	// Return JSX
	return (
		<div>
			<MyContext.Provider value={valueObject}>
				<Child />
			</MyContext.Provider>
		</div>
	);
};

export default App;

```

#### Access in Functional Component
we can access __React Context__ Object with `useContext()` hook.

```js 
import React from 'react';
import { useContext } from 'react';

import MyContext from '../../context/MyContext.js';

const Child = () => {

	const { name } = useContext(MyContext);
	console.log(name);
	// Return JSX
	return <div>Child</div>;
};

export default Child;

```

#### Access in class component
```js 
	<MyContext.Consumer>
		{(data) => {
			console.log(data);
		}}
	</MyContext.Consumer>
```
#### Access in Functional Component

```js 
import { createContext } from "react";

import "./styles.css";
import MyComponent from "./MyComponent";

export const MyContext = createContext();

export default function App() {
  return (
    <MyContext.Provider value={{ name: "Praveen" }}>
      <div className="App">
        <MyComponent />
      </div>
    </MyContext.Provider>
  );
}

```

```js 
import { useContext } from "react";
import { MyContext } from "./App";

export default function MyComponent() {
  const { name } = useContext(MyContext);
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>Hello CodeSandbox</h1>
      <p>{name}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

```

<summary>Redux Toolkit</summary>

## Redux
Redux is a Data Layer.  
Redux is not a mandatory to manage a Global State.
Building small app, there is no need to use Redux.  
Redux is not a part of the **react**. both are separate libraries.
Redux is used to application is very easy to debug.
Redux is used to create a global central Space.
Redux is not only the library for managing the state.
* redux -> Global state management
* zustand -> Global state management

### Redux team
1. React-Redux
2. Redux-Toolkit

### Redux-Toolkit (RTK) Setup
* Install `@reduxjs/redux-toolkit` and `react-redux `
* Build our store
* connect store to our App
* create Slice -> add slices to store
* dispatch (action)
* selector => Access Store
* Check in redux dev tools

#### Build Our Store

```js 
/* -----> Third Party Packages <----- */
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

/* -----> Slices <----- */
import mySlice from './mySlice';

/* -----> Configuration <----- */
const appStore = configureStore({
	reducer: {
		// combine all slice reducers
		my: mySlice,
	},
});

/* -----> Export <----- */
export default appStore;

```

#### Add global state to APP

```js 
import { Provider } from 'react-redux'
import store from "./store/appStore"

    <Provider store={myStore}>
			<App />
	</Provider>
```

#### create slice
```js 
/* -----> Third Party Packages <----- */
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

/* -----> initial State <----- */
const initialState = { isLogin: true };

/* -----> Slice <----- */
const mySlice = createSlice({
	name: 'cart',
	initialState,
	reducers: {
		// Actions
		changeLogin: (state, action) => {
			state.isLogin = !state.isLogin;
		},
	},
});

/* -----> Export <----- */
export const { changeLogin } = mySlice.actions; // Actions
export default mySlice.reducer; // Reducer

```

#### Access Store 
`useSelector` hook is used  Subscribe to the store. 

```js
import {useSelector} from "react-redux";
const isLogin = useSelector((store) => store.my.isLogin)
```

#### dispatching 
`useDispatch` hook is used dispatch the action to store. 

```js
import {useDispatch} from "react-redux";
import {changeLogin} from "../../store/mySlice"

// dispatch an action 
const dispatch = useDispatch();

return (
	<button type="button" onClick={() => {dispatch(changeLogin(false));}}>
				Off
	</button>
)

```

<summary>Storage</summary>

## Storage
1. Local Storage 
2. Session Storage
3. Cookies Storage
4. IndexedDb

### `js-cookies` 
storing data on client-side with expiry duration.
`js-cookies` is a Third Party Package.
* `Cookies.set('CookieName', 'CookieValue', {expires: DAYS})`
* `const token = Cookies.get('CookieName');`
* `Cookies.remove("CookieName")`

</details>

<details>
<summary>Styles</summary>

## Styles
we can style the React Component by using:
1. Inline
2. custom css file
3. Tailwind
4. styled Components

### Inline Styles

```js 
const styles = {
  paragraph: {
    'fontSize':'10px',
    'color':'#ff0000'
  }

  heading: {
    'fontSize':'24px',
    'color':'green'
  }
}

return (
<p style={styles.paragraph}>This is my first text</p>
)
```

### tailwindcss
website : `https://tailwindcss.com/`
* Disadvantages : we can write more lengthy code in className attribute.

```powershell
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss
npx tailwindcss init
```

```js
// `ctrl + spacebar` : Suggestions
// Dynamic tailwindcss -> use square brackets [] 
<div className="bg-red-400 w-[200px]"></div> 
```

### Styled Components
Styled Components are one of the new ways to use CSS in modern React. These are used to reuse styles.
We can use the third-party package `styled-components` to write Styled Components in the React Application.

```js 
import styled from "styled-components";

export const Heading = styled.h1`
  color: #0070c1;
  font-family: "Roboto";
`;
```

```js 
import "./App.css";
import { Heading } from "./styledComponents";

const App = () => <Heading>Hello World</Heading>;

export default App;
```

<details>
<summary>API</summary>

## API
__API__ stands for __Application Programming Interface__

### API integration
The API integration can be defined as the process of creating interaction for two or more APIs to share data and communicate with each other without human interruption.

#### axios
Axios is a third-party package for making HTTP requests.

It is similar to the `fetch` method.

* Installation Command
  `npm install axios`

* Uses
  - `axios.get(URL, CONFIG)`
  - `axios.post(URL, DATA, CONFIG)`
  - `axios.put(URL, DATA, CONFIG)`
  - `axios.delete(URL, CONFIG)`

### Component Views ( API )
1. Loading View
2. Success View
3. Failure View

### Q: What is `CORS`?
__CORS__ stands for __Cross-Origin Resource Sharing__.  
CORS is used to calls from one domain to another domain.

Example :
`https://corsproxy.io/?{myapi}`

### Optional Chaining
`Optional Chaining` (`?.`) operator accesses an object's property or calls a function. If the object accessed or function called is `undefined or null` , it returns `undefined` instead of throwing an error.
Example : `data?.card`

### || operator
If there is available it gives, otherwise it gives last item.
```js 
const data = apiData || hardData
```

### Shimmer UI
* There was a research done and earlier people used to saw __spinning__ loaders at first and then suddenly every Card come up. This is bad experience.  
* Human brain don't like to view so many fluctuations in the UI, according to psychology. Psychologist figured out that, instead of spinners empty boxes should be shown. It is a better UI experience for the users.  
* A `Shimmer UI` resembles the page's actual UI, It gives people an idea of what's about to come and what's happening (while UI currently loading) when a page full of content/data takes more than 3 - 5 seconds to load.
* Shimmer UI is a great way for loading the applications. Instead of showing a loading circle we can design a shimmer UI for our application that is good for user experience.

<details>
<summary>Lazy Loading</summary>

## Lazy Loading
Bundler takes all your files and bundle into one file.  
All the `js` files bundle into 1 file is good. but some cases 1000 files bundle into 1 file is not good. also don't call 1000 files in browser. browser do a lot of work to call 1000 files.
* we do logically break your entire application into smaller applications.
* So We make small bundles to fast our App.
* When we need then only load that component.

Lazy Loading has many names : 
1. Chunking
2. Code Splitting
3. Dynamic Bundling
4. Lazy Loading
5. On demand loading

 ### Bundle `<MyComponent/>`
 Create separate bundle for MyComponent.
 If we use LazyLoading, initial our MyComponent code is not in app bundler, when we go the MyComponent page then only MyComponent will load.

#### lazy
The lazy function in React allows you to import components asynchronously, meaning they are loaded only when needed. 

#### Suspense
The Suspense component is another feature of React that helps manage asynchronous rendering.

```js 
import React, { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';

// Lazily importing MyComponent
const MyComponent = lazy(() => import('./components/MyComponent'));

const routes = [
  {
    path: '/my-component',
    element: (
      <Suspense fallback="Loading...">
        <MyComponent />
      </Suspense>
    )
  },
  // Other routes can be defined here
];

```

<details>
<summary>DOM</summary>

## DOM
__DOM__ stands for __Document Object Model__

### Types of DOMs
1. Real DOM
2. Virtual DOM

#### Real DOM 
__HTML DOM__ is called __Real DOM__.
* The Real DOM is __UI__ of our application.
* It is the structured representation of the HTML document created by the browser. 
* It allows JavaScript to manipulate, structure, and style of your website.

#### Virtual DOM
* DOM is created by React JS is called Virtual DOM.
* The virtual DOM is only a virtual representation of the Real DOM.
* whenever new elements are added to the UI, a new virtual DOM is created.
- Virtual DOM is not a Real DOM.
- Virtual DOM is normal JS Object.
- JS Object is very light-weight.

| **Real DOM**                             | **Virtual DOM**                                |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| DOM manipulation is very expensive       | DOM manipulation is very cheap                 |
| There is too much memory wastage         | No memory wastage                              |
| It updates Slow                          | It updates fast                                |
| It can directly update HTML              | It can’t update HTML directly                  |
| It represents the UI of your application | It is only a virtual representation of the DOM |

#### ReactDOM
__ReactDOM__ is the part of React that allows React to interact with the Real DOM.

```js 
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import App from './App'

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root'),
)
```

### Why React is fast?
* React is very fast Because it has `virtual DOM`, `Reconciliation`, `Diff algorithm`. 
* React is fast because of its fast DOM manipulation.

### Reconciliation
* we need virtual DOM for Reconciliation. 
* React stores a copy of Browser DOM which is called `Virtual DOM`.
* Reconciliation is uses `Diff Algorithm`.
* `Diff Algorithm` checks difference between two virtual DOMs.
* When we make changes or add data, React creates a new Virtual DOM and compares it with the previous one. Comparison is done by `Diffing Algorithm`.
* Reconciliation quickly updates it in UI (Real DOM).
* React compares new virtual DOM with current virtual DOM, and the difference will be updated to the Real DOM.
* It finds out the changed nodes and updates only the changed nodes in Real DOM leaving the rest nodes as it is. This process is called Reconciliation.

### Q: What is `React Fiber`?
In React 16, Diff algorithm changed a little and React introduced React Fiber.  
React Fiber is a concept of ReactJS that is used to render a system faster, smoother and smarter.
The Fiber reconciler, which became the default reconciler for React 16 and above, is a complete rewrite of React’s reconciliation algorithm to solve some long-standing issues in React.

### Why React is faster than JS?
Actually __react__ is a JavaScript library, SO React is as fast as javascript.

<summary>React Events</summary>

## React Events
Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements.  
There are some syntax differences:

1. React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.

|   HTML   |      JSX |
| :------: | -------: |
| onclick  |  onClick |
|  onblur  |   onBlur |
| onchange | onChange |


```js 
/* -----> Third Party Packages <----- */
import {Component} from 'react' // Component is for creating class Components

/* -----> Creating Components <----- */

// class Component
class App extends Component{
   
    // Methods
    onButtonClick = () => {
        console.log("clicked")
    }

    // Updating
    render(){

        // Return JSX
        return (
            <div className="card-component">
                <p>Click on Button and see on console</p>
                <button onClick={this.onButtonClick} type="button">Button</button>
            </div>
        )
    }
}

/* -----> Default Export <----- */
export default App;

```

### Synthetic Events
* React has its own special way of handling events, and they're called synthetic events.
* These events help your app work smoothly for everyone, even if they're using old browsers.
* They ensure that your app behaves the same way, no matter where it's opened—like a friendly language that all browsers understand.
* Instead of dealing with how each browser talks about events, React simplifies it for you. It's like having a chat with events, and everyone agrees on the same rules, no matter the browser.
Example : Imagine clicking a button
With real DOM events, how it works can vary across browsers. But with synthetic events, it's like clicking a universal button - your code reacts the same way every time, no matter what browser someone's using.

```js 
const handleClick = (event) => {
  // Stop the button from doing its usual thing (e.g., prevent a form from submitting)
  event.preventDefault();// prevents all the default behavior by the browser.

  // Stop the event from telling its parent about the click
  event.stopPropagation();  // prevents the call to the parent component whenever a child component gets called.

  // Now, do your own custom code for the button click
  console.log('Button clicked!');
}

<button type="button" onClick={handleClick}>Click</button>

```

<details>
<summary>Forms</summary>

## Forms

### controlled Input
If the Input Element value is handled by a React State then it is called Controlled Input

### Uncontrolled Input
* If the Input Element value is handled by the browser itself then it is called Uncontrolled Input.
* Its value can only be set by a user, but not programmatically.

<summary>Conditional Rendering</summary>

## Conditional Rendering
Here, we need to render either a shimmer UI or a data UI
1. if statement 
2. && Operator -> Logical
3. ? Operator  -> Ternary

```js 
// if statement -> Early Return
if (!myList) return <Shimmer/> 

return <MyComponent/>
```

```js
// Ternary operator
{!myList ?  <Shimmer /> :  <MyComponent />};
```

```js
// if…else Statement
  (if (myList.length === 0) {
    return <Shimmer />;
  }else {
    return <MyComponent />;
  })
```


```js
// Using Logical &&
{isLoggedIn && <button>Logout</button>}
```


 ```js
return(myList.length === 0) ? <Shimer/> : <MyComponent/> 
```

 ```js  
return(myList?.length === 0) ? <Shiimer/> : <MyComponent/>

<summary>Testing</summary>

## Testing
1. Manual Testing
2. Developer Testing (code testing)

### Developer Testing 
1. Unit Testing
2. Integration Testing 
3. End-to-End Testing - e2e testing

#### Unit Testing
Test specific part of the React application, not whole application.

#### Integration Testing
Test the Integration of multiple components. 

#### End-to-End Testing
test the all the flows.

### react testing library 
react testing library uses __jest__.

#### Setting up Testing in our application 
1. Install React Testing Library 
2. Install jest
3. Install Babel dependencies 
4. Configure Babel
5. Configure parcel config file to disable default babel transpilation. 
6. jest configuration - `npx jest --init`
7. install jsdom library
8. install @babel/preset-react - to make JSX work in test cases
9. Include @babel/preset-react inside my babel
10. Include @testing-library/jest-dom

### run test cases
npm run test 

### create testcase
1. folder => `__tests__` => All the files inside this folder are test files.
2. file  
* `Component.test.js`
* `Component.test.ts`
* `Component.spec.js`
* `Component.spec.ts`


#### Unit testcase Example 
```js 
import {sum} from "./Utils"

// test(descriptioon, callback)
test('Sum function should calculate the sum of two numbers', () => {
	const result = Sum(3, 4);

	// Assertion
	expect(result).toBe(7);
});
```

### Writing testcase steps
1. render
2. Querying
3. Assertion


#### Write Group testcase

```js 
import Contact from "./Components/Contact"

describe('Contact Us Page Test Case', () => {
	test('should load contact us component', () => {
		render(<Contact />);

		const heading = screen.getByRole('heading');

		// Assertion
		expect(heading).toBeInTheDocument();
	});
 
    // it or test 
	test('should load contact us component', () => {
		render(<Contact />);

		const button = screen.getByRole('button');

		// Assertion
		expect(button).toBeInTheDocument();
	});

	
});
```
